# Vending Machine 

This project doesnt contain an UI part, the idea is to create all the methods and functions that a vending machine could use, and we are gonna test with 10 differents test. 

## Technologies 

### [Jests](https://jestjs.io)
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## In this project you will find

* 10 well-formed, passing tests
* Reasonably DRY (don’t repeat yourself) implementation, though the tests can be verbose
* Test will specifically describe the behaviour of the code
* A screenshot in the repository’s README.md of the test output from the terminal
* A class to build the vending machine
* User Can interact with methods:

  * Print vending machine inventory
  * Refill vending machine inventory
  * Re-supply vending machine change
  * Dispense inventory based on payment
  * Return change as coins (e.g. \$0.35 is 1 quarter and 1 dime)
  * Dispense the fewest number of coins possible when returning change
  * Allow variable products in any slot
